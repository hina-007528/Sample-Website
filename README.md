<h1>My First Web Development Project: A Website for Beginners 🎉</h1>
Excited to share my first sample website, built as part of my journey into web development. I focused on creating a user-friendly, responsive website that works flawlessly across both desktop and mobile devices. This project is a blend of creativity and technical skills, incorporating basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🔍 Key Features:

Fully responsive for all screen sizes.

Simple HTML/CSS layout with a minimalistic, clean design.

Basic JavaScript interactions for added user engagement.

I’ve learned a lot from this project and look forward to building more advanced websites as I continue my learning path in the tech world! 🚀
